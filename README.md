<h1 align="center">👋 Hey there, I’m <your_name>!</h1>

<p align="center">
  Just a regular human being — part-time IT guy, part-time "hacker" who’s only ever managed to hack himself.  
  <br>
  My twisted mind keeps whispering <i>"press the buttons..."</i>, so I do — I smash random keys on my keyboard, hit <b>ENTER</b>, and watch what explodes.  
  <br>
  Sometimes it works… sometimes it sets something on fire. So yeah — use my projects at your own risk 🔥

### 🧠 About Me
- 💻 I write code mostly because I’m curious what will break this time.  
- ⚙️ Sometimes I actually finish a project — and it even works (miracles do happen).  
- 🦠 Other times... it turns into a digital gremlin that might just eat your computer.  
- 🧩 When the key-smashing ritual succeeds, you’ll find the results right here.
