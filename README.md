<h1 align="center">👋 Hey there, I’m <your_name>!</h1>

<p align="center">
  Just a regular human being — part-time Noob, part-time "hacker" who’s only ever managed to hack himself.  
  <br>
  My twisted mind keeps whispering <i>"press the buttons..."</i>, so I do — I smash random keys on my keyboard, hit <b>ENTER</b>, and watch what explodes.  
  <br>
  Sometimes it works… sometimes it sets something on fire. So yeah — use my projects at your own risk 🔥

### 🧠 About Me
- 💻 I write code mostly because I’m curious what will break this time.  
- ⚙️ Sometimes I actually finish a project — and it even works (miracles do happen).  
- 🦠 Other times... it turns into a digital gremlin that might just eat your computer.  
- 🧩 When the key-smashing ritual succeeds, you’ll find the results right here.

### 🐉 About Draconus

> “A creature born from curiosity, caffeine, and poor life choices.”

**Draconus** is my personal experiment in chaos —  
a C2 framework that blends ethical hacking, malware research, and pure curiosity.  
It speaks in sockets, hides behind Wine, and occasionally spawns new worms just for fun.  
Everything is modular, experimental, and slightly dangerous — just how I like it.



### ⚔️ Motto

> **“If it compiles, it’s not a bug — it’s a feature.”**  
> _“And if it doesn’t… well, that’s tomorrow’s problem.”_

### ☕ Fun Fact

> Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie…  
> where you are also the murderer, the victim, and the guy who deleted the logs.
